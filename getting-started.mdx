## Download and install

Download the desktop app from the [setup page](https://quadrillion.io/dashboard/setup).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Download the `.zip` for your chip:
    - **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4): `qualia-*-macos-arm64.zip`
    - **Intel**: `qualia-*-macos-x64.zip`

    Unzip and drag **Qualia** to your Applications folder. On first launch, macOS may ask you to confirm since the app was downloaded from the internet.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    Download and extract the `.tar.gz`:
    ```bash
    tar -xzf qualia-*-linux-x64.tar.gz
    ./qualia
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Qualia checks for updates automatically on launch and prompts you when a new version is available.


## Your first session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a notebook">
    Click **New Notebook** in the Files sidebar, or open an existing `.ipynb` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start chatting">
    Type a message in the chat panel on the right. Try something like:

    - *"Load the iris dataset and show me a summary"*
    - *"Train some CNNs on the MNIST dataset"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="See results">
    Qualia writes code cells, runs them, and shows the output — plots, tables, text — directly in the notebook. You can see and edit every cell it creates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Toggle the chat panel with **Cmd+Escape** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Escape** (Linux).
