Open Settings by clicking the gear icon in the bottom-left corner of the sidebar.

## Models

### Default model
The model used for chat and code generation. Switch between providers and models at any time.

### Subagent model
The model used when an agent spawns sub-agents. You might want a faster, cheaper model here for parallel work.

### Autocomplete model
Powers inline code completions as you type. A smaller, faster model usually works best.

## Editor

### Default kernel
Select which Jupyter kernel Qualia uses for new notebooks. If you have multiple Python environments (conda, virtualenv, etc.), select the one you want here.

Qualia validates that the selected kernel is installed and available. If it's not, you'll see a warning.

## AI behavior

### Web search
Enable or disable web search. When active, Qualia can look up documentation and references during conversations.

### Agent confirmation
When enabled, agents ask for approval before executing actions. Disable for a faster, more autonomous experience.

### Custom instructions
Persistent guidelines that apply to every conversation. Write up to 7,500 characters of instructions.

Qualia also includes preset instructions for common domains (quantitative finance, biochemistry, software engineering). Select one preset per category — they stack with your personal instructions.

## Matplotlib

Fine-grained control over plot appearance:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **DPI** | Plot resolution |
| **Figure size** | Width and height in inches |
| **Colormap** | Default colormap for heatmaps and continuous scales |
| **Color cycle** | Colors used for plot lines and bars |
| **Font** | Font family and size |
| **Line width** | Default line thickness |
| **Grid** | Show or hide gridlines |
| **Export DPI/format** | Settings for saved figures |

You can create custom color schemes and save them for reuse.
