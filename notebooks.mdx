Qualia is a complete Jupyter-compatible notebook IDE. Everything you create is saved as standard `.ipynb` files that work in JupyterLab, VS Code, or any other notebook tool.

## Creating and managing notebooks

- Click **New Notebook** in the Files sidebar to create a notebook
- Open existing `.ipynb` files by clicking them in the file browser
- Open multiple notebooks in tabs and switch between them
- Rename, duplicate, or delete files by right-clicking in the sidebar
- **Reveal in Finder/Explorer**: right-click a file to open its location on disk

Recently opened notebooks appear at the top of the Files sidebar for quick access.

## Writing and running code

### Cell types
- **Code cells**: Python (or R) with syntax highlighting, bracket matching, and auto-indentation
- **Markdown cells**: Rich text with LaTeX math support via KaTeX

### Running cells

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Shift+Enter** | Run cell and move to the next one |
| **Cmd/Ctrl+Enter** | Run cell and stay on it |
| **Alt+Enter** | Run cell and insert a new cell below |

You can also run all cells in order, or run a selection of cells.

### Cell operations

In **command mode** (press Escape first):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **A** | Insert cell above |
| **B** | Insert cell below |
| **D, D** | Delete cell (press D twice) |
| **M** | Convert to markdown |
| **Y** | Convert to code |
| **C** | Copy cell |
| **V** | Paste cell below |
| **Shift+M** | Merge selected cells |
| **Shift+L** | Toggle line numbers |
| Arrow keys or **J/K** | Navigate between cells |

Press **Enter** to go back to edit mode.

### Outputs

Qualia renders all standard Jupyter output types:
- Text (print statements, return values)
- Tables (pandas DataFrames render as formatted tables)
- Plots (matplotlib, plotly, seaborn)
- Images
- Interactive widgets (ipywidgets)
- Error tracebacks with syntax highlighting

## Built-in terminal

Qualia includes an integrated terminal. Open it to run shell commands without leaving the app.

## Search

### Find in notebook
Press **Cmd/Ctrl+F** to search within the current notebook. Supports:
- Case-sensitive matching
- Whole-word matching
- Regular expressions

### Search across files
The Search sidebar (magnifying glass icon) searches across all files in your workspace using ripgrep for fast full-text search.

## File export

Export notebooks as standalone files with all variable references resolved. This is useful for sharing your work — the exported notebook runs without needing Qualia.

## Matplotlib customization

Qualia gives you fine-grained control over how plots look:

- **DPI and figure size**: Set resolution and dimensions
- **Color cycles**: Choose from built-in palettes (including Qualia's own) or create custom ones
- **Colormaps**: Pick defaults for heatmaps and continuous color scales
- **Typography**: Set font family and size
- **Grid and line width**: Control plot styling

Configure all of this in **Settings > Matplotlib**. Changes apply to all new plots.

## Tags

Organize your notebooks with tags. Add tags from the cell toolbar to categorize cells by purpose (e.g., "preprocessing", "model-v2", "visualization"). Tags are saved in the notebook metadata and persist across sessions.
