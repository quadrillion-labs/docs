description: "Run parallel experiments, spawn sub-agents, and let Qualia work autonomously."
---

Qualia's agent system lets you go beyond single-threaded conversations. You can run multiple experiments in parallel, delegate sub-tasks to independent agents, and let Qualia work autonomously for hours while you do something else.

## Starting an agent

Click the New Agent button in the top left.

## Parallel agents

The biggest time sink in research is sequential experimentation — you try one thing, wait, check results, then try the next. Qualia eliminates that by running multiple agents in parallel.

### Example: model comparison

Ask Qualia:

> *"Compare three approaches: (1) random forest with default hyperparameters, (2) XGBoost with early stopping, and (3) a small neural network. Use 5-fold cross-validation for each. Run them in parallel."*

Qualia spawns three agents, each working on one approach simultaneously. When they finish, you can compare results side by side.

### Example: hyperparameter sweep

> *"Try learning rates of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 with the current model. Train each for 50 epochs and compare validation loss curves."*

### Example: feature engineering

> *"Test three feature sets: (1) just the raw numeric columns, (2) with polynomial features, (3) with target encoding on categoricals. See which gives the best F1 score."*

### Managing agents

The **Agents sidebar** (chat bubble icon) shows all your agents:

- **Status indicators**: Running (spinner), completed (checkmark), paused, stopped, or waiting
- **Hierarchy view**: See parent-child relationships between agents and sub-agents
- **Actions**: Pause, resume, stop, or delete any agent

## Autonomous runs

You can set agents to **Infinity** independence and let them run for hours without intervention.

### How it works

1. Describe a research direction: *"Explore different architectures for this timeseries forecasting problem. Try at least 5 approaches and report the best."*
2. Set independence to **Infinity**
3. Qualia works autonomously — training models, testing variations, iterating on promising leads
4. When it finds something interesting or finishes, it reports back

### Slack integration

Connect Slack in **Settings** to get updates from autonomous agents:

1. Go to **Settings > Slack**
2. Click **Connect to Slack** and authorize
3. Select a channel for updates

Autonomous agents will post progress updates and results to your Slack channel while they work. You can propose new directions directly from Slack, and Qualia will adjust its approach.

## Confirmation requests

When an agent wants to do something potentially risky — like installing a package, running a destructive shell command, or making an irreversible change — it pauses and asks for your confirmation.

You'll see a confirmation dialog with:
- What the agent wants to do
- Why it wants to do it
- Options to approve, deny, or modify the action

Agents at **Infinity** independence skip confirmations entirely, which is why that level is intended for trusted background work.

## Todo tracking

Agents create and maintain todo lists as they work through complex tasks. You can see the current todo list in the chat panel — items are marked as pending, in progress, or completed as the agent progresses.

This gives you visibility into what the agent is doing and how far along it is, even during long autonomous runs.
