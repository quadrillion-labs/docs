title: Chat & AI
description: "Talk to Qualia in plain English to analyze data, write code, and run experiments."
---

The chat panel is how you interact with Qualia. Describe what you want in natural language and Qualia writes code, runs it, and shows you the results.

## Basics

Type a message in the chat input at the bottom of the panel. Qualia will:

1. Read your message and understand what you want
2. Look at the current state of your notebook for context
3. Write and execute code cells to accomplish your goal
4. Show results (plots, tables, text) inline in the notebook

You always see the code that runs. Nothing happens behind the scenes — every action appears as a notebook cell you can inspect and edit.

Qualia maintains conversation history, so you can refer back to earlier results, refine approaches, and build on prior work naturally.

## Things you can ask Qualia to do

### Explore and clean data
- *"Load sales_data.csv and show me the first 10 rows"*
- *"What's the distribution of the price column? Show me a histogram"*
- *"Remove duplicates and fill missing values in the age column with the median"*
- *"Give me summary statistics grouped by region"*

### Build visualizations
- *"Plot a scatter matrix of all numeric columns"*
- *"Show me daily revenue as a time series with a 7-day moving average"*
- *"Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix"*
- *"Make a bar chart comparing accuracy across the three models"*

### Train and evaluate models
- *"Train a gradient boosted classifier on this data"*
- *"Compare random forest vs. logistic regression with 5-fold cross-validation"*
- *"Show me feature importances and the ROC curve"*
- *"Tune the learning rate and max depth using grid search"*

### Work with files and the shell
- *"Install scikit-learn and xgboost"*
- *"What files are in the data/ directory?"*
- *"Run the preprocessing script at scripts/clean.py"*
- *"Search the codebase for where the model is saved"*

### Research and look things up
- *"Search the web for the latest scikit-learn docs on HistGradientBoosting"*
- *"What's the standard approach for handling class imbalance?"*

<Info>
  Web search can be enabled in **Settings**. When active, Qualia can look up documentation and references during your conversation.

## Attaching context

You can attach specific context to your messages so Qualia knows exactly what you're referring to:

- **Cells**: Select one or more notebook cells to include as context. Qualia sees both the code and its output.
- **Files**: Attach files from your filesystem for Qualia to read.
- **Table selections**: Select rows or columns from a data table and attach the selection.

This is useful when you want Qualia to focus on a specific piece of your work rather than the whole notebook.

## Custom instructions

You can give Qualia persistent instructions that apply to every conversation:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Custom Instructions**
3. Write guidelines for how Qualia should behave

For example:
- *"Always use polars instead of pandas"*
- *"Use PyTorch, not TensorFlow"*
- *"Follow PEP 8 style strictly"*
- *"When training models, always set a random seed for reproducibility"*

Qualia also ships with preset instructions for common domains:

| Preset | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| **Quantitative Finance** | Backtesting, risk management, statistical testing |
| **Biochemistry** | Cheminformatics, compound analysis, therapeutic targets |
| **Software Engineering** | Clean code, testing, maintainability |

You can select one preset per category (company, team, personal) and they stack together.

## Code autocomplete

As you type in code cells, Qualia offers AI-powered autocomplete suggestions. These appear inline and you can accept them with Tab.

Autocomplete uses the notebook context — nearby cells and their outputs — to make relevant suggestions. You can pick which model powers autocomplete in **Settings > Models**.
