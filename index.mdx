Qualia is a research agent built by [Quadrillion Labs](https://quadrillion.io) that lives inside a Jupyter notebook. It can ideate, run experiments, clean data, build visualizations, and train models — all through natural conversation.

Think of it as a tireless collaborator that handles the tedious parts of research so you can focus on the interesting questions.

## Who it's for

Qualia is built for practical research workflows. It's used by:

- **ML engineers** iterating on model architectures and training pipelines
- **Quants** building and backtesting strategies
- **Data scientists** exploring datasets and building features
- **Researchers** running experiments and analyzing results

## How it's different

Most AI coding tools help you write snippets. Qualia is designed for sustained research: it maintains context across long sessions, coordinates parallel experiments, and can run autonomously for hours. It's a research partner, not just autocomplete.
