Most AI coding tools generate snippets and hope for the best. Qualia is different. It's a research agent that lives inside a Jupyter notebook and actually does the work — cleaning data, running experiments, training models, iterating on results — through natural conversation.

Think of it less like autocomplete and more like a collaborator who never loses context, never gets tired, and can explore ten directions at once.

Qualia is built by [Quadrillion Labs](https://quadrillion.io), a team of researchers and former quants who got tired of the gap between having an idea and seeing results.
